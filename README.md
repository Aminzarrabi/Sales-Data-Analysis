# 📊 Sales Data Analysis Project (Python)

This project focuses on analyzing multi-year sales data for **Sib Company**, a leading exporter of non-oil products to various countries worldwide.

The company provided historical sales data stored in an Excel file (`sales.xlsx`) and hired us as a **Data Analyst** at its headquarters in Iran to extract insights and answer key business questions.

The analysis is structured into **five main stages**, covering data preprocessing, exploratory analysis, market evaluation, customer segmentation, and customer retention analysis.
